# WUST-BACKEND

ðŸ“Ÿ Comics reader backend 

## Setup

Clone 
```
git clone git@github.com:Sloth-Wizard/wust-backend.git
```

Move into clone folder
```
cd wust-api
```

First we check dependencies so run
```
cargo check
```

If you get errors, verify the ```Cargo.toml``` file and update dependencies then re-run the check    

If no problem are encoutered, start the server
```
cargo run
```
This will run the server on the ```127.0.0.1:3000``` by default, you can change it to what you want    

## Database

Be sure to have a clone of the ```dev``` or ```prod``` database up and running locally

## OpenSSL

To generate our needed keys, head to the `tools/jwt_gen` folder and run the `jwtgen.sh` script

Then you can copy and paste the public key inside `src/oauth/pem` folder
